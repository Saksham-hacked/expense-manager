## What Was Done

Your Backend Orchestrator project was **already complete** when I reviewed it. The previous code generation hit the token limit but had successfully created all necessary files. 

I have verified the entire codebase and added comprehensive supporting documentation to make it production-ready.

## Interview Talking Points

### "What is this project?"
> "An AI-powered backend orchestrator that translates natural language into structured MCP tool calls. It's not a traditional REST API—it's an intelligent decision layer that uses LLMs to understand user intent while maintaining strict security boundaries and multi-user isolation."

### "Why is the LLM in the backend?"
> "To maintain MCP philosophy. MCP servers should be pure capability executors—just tools with well-defined inputs/outputs. By keeping the LLM in the backend, we preserve modularity. The same expense MCP server can serve any frontend without needing to understand natural language."

### "How do you ensure security?"
> "Three layers: OAuth for authentication, AES-256-GCM for encrypting user API keys, and user_id injection into every MCP call for data isolation. The backend validates everything before execution, and there's strict allow-listing of tools."
